# GBP - Group Based Policy

These GBP demo scripts introduce Group-Based Policy (GBP), a framework designed to offer a set of API extensions to manage OpenStack 
infrastructure through policy abstraction. 

GBP is intent driven and designed on the principle of capturing application requirements directly to meet business goals 
as opposed to converting the requirements into a specific set of infrastructure configurations. the focus is very much on 
the ‘what’ as opposed to the ‘how’.

The goal ultimately is for exposed APIs to automate technical delivery using the power of OpenStack and the underlying infrastructure. 
Initially it was targeted at OpenStack networking resources, but the abstractions are general enough to apply to compute and storage 
resources as well.

GBP project management (blueprints, bugs) is done via Launchpad: <http://launchpad.net/group-based-policy>
